# Reach strategy: 5M impressions in 3 months

Goal: **5 million impressions in 3 months** (~55k/day average). This doc outlines timing and habits to maximize reach and set you up for Twitter/X revenue (e.g. Creator subscriptions, Ads revenue share).

## 1. Tweet timing (when folks are on Twitter)

Schedule is set for **peak usage** so more people see your tweets:

| Run | IST      | UTC  | Why |
|-----|----------|------|-----|
| 1   | 8 AM     | 2:30 | India morning, US evening (9:30 PM EST). Good for India start-of-day. |
| 2   | 1 PM     | 7:30 | India lunch scroll, Europe morning. |
| 3   | **6:30 PM** | **13:00** | India evening + **US morning (9 AM EST)**. Studies show 8–9 AM weekdays = highest engagement in many regions. |

- **Weekdays** (Tue–Thu) usually outperform weekends; your cron runs every day so you naturally get more weekday volume.
- If your audience is mostly India, 8 AM / 1 PM / 6:30 PM IST are strong. The 6:30 PM slot also lines up with US 9 AM for global reach.

Workflows: `tweet-run-1.yml`, `tweet-run-2.yml`, `tweet-run-3.yml` (crons above).

## 2. What actually grows reach (and revenue)

- **Consistency** – You’re already doing 3/day. Keep the schedule; the algorithm favors accounts that post regularly.
- **Engagement** – Reply to comments, quote your own tweets with a follow-up, and engage in replies on other DevOps/SRE/cricket tweets. Engagement in the first 30–60 minutes after posting matters most.
- **Quality** – Morning tweets now include data/theory so people can read and learn. Afternoon = questions, evening = polls/cricket. Variety + substance helps retention and shares.
- **Hashtags & links** – You’re using real hashtags and valid URLs; that helps discoverability and looks credible.
- **Revenue** – Monetization (Creator subscriptions, Ads revenue share) usually needs eligibility (e.g. X Premium, follower/engagement thresholds). Focus on reach and engagement first; then apply for monetization when you qualify.

## 3. Rough math (5M in 3 months)

- 5M ÷ 90 days ≈ **55.5k impressions/day**.
- At 3 tweets/day ≈ **18.5k impressions per tweet** on average.
- Early on, per-tweet impressions may be lower; as followers and engagement grow, they can rise. Hitting 5M in 3 months is ambitious but possible with consistent posting, good timing, and real engagement (replies, follows, sharing).

## 4. Quick checklist

- [ ] Keep 3 tweets/day at 8 AM, 1 PM, 6:30 PM IST.
- [ ] Check notifications and reply in the first hour after each tweet when you can.
- [ ] Engage in other people’s replies (DevOps, SRE, cricket) to bring new eyes to your profile.
- [ ] When eligible, turn on X monetization (Creator subscriptions / Ads revenue share) in account settings.
