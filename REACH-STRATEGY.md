# 5M impressions in 3 months — CEO playbook

**Goal:** 5 million impressions in 90 days (~55.5k/day).  
**Mindset:** Treat your timeline as a product. Distribution and engagement are as important as content.

---

## 1. The math (so we know what we’re building)

| Target | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Total impressions | 5,000,000 |
| Days | 90 |
| Per day | ~55,500 |
| Tweets/day | 4 (see below) |
| Per tweet (avg) | ~13,900 |

If you do **3 tweets/day**, you need ~18.5k per tweet. If you add a **4th tweet** at a peak time, you need ~13.9k per tweet. More quality slots = more shots at the algorithm and more total reach. So the playbook assumes **4 tweets/day** and uses the rest of the strategy to maximize per-tweet performance and follower growth.

## 2. Product: what you ship every day

| Slot | Time (IST) | Job of the tweet | Why it works |
|------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Morning** | 8 AM | Data/theory — “something to read” | Builds authority. People save and share. |
| **Midday** | 1 PM | Question — “what do you use / how do you handle” | Reply magnet. Algorithm loves replies. |
| **Evening** | 6:30 PM | Poll or cricket | Polls = easy engagement. Cricket = different audience + personal brand. |
| **Late** | 9 PM | Fourth type (question/poll/cricket/info by rotation) | US afternoon (11:30 AM EST). Extra touchpoint. |

- **Morning:** Already set up with metric/concept/how-it-works. No change.
- **Afternoon + Late:** Questions and takes are your main growth levers. Keep them specific and easy to answer.
- **Evening:** Polls and cricket stay. They drive likes/replies and variety.

**One signature:** Pick one thing people remember (e.g. “always ends with a question” or “always has a number”). Your current format (paragraph gaps + URL + hashtags) is already a signature. Keep it.

## 3. Distribution: get in front of people who don’t follow you yet

- **Replies on big accounts:** Every day, reply to **3–5 tweets** from larger DevOps/SRE/cricket accounts. Add real value (insight, short tip, or genuine question). Don’t pitch. You show up in their reply stream; their followers discover you.
- **Hashtags:** Use 1–2 per tweet. Rotate: #DevOps #SRE #Kubernetes #Cloud #T20WorldCup2026 etc. Enough volume that people search, not so huge that you disappear.
- **Cross-post best tweets:** Once a week, take your best morning (data/theory) tweet and post it on LinkedIn with a line like “Shared this on X earlier — adding it here for the feed.” Drives a few followers back to X.
- **Pin one tweet:** Pin a tweet that says who you are and what you tweet (DevOps/SRE + cricket, 4x/day, “something to read in the morning”). New visitors convert better when they understand the account in 5 seconds.

## 4. Engagement loops (this is what actually scales reach)

- **First 60 minutes:** Reply to every comment in the first hour after posting. The algorithm uses early engagement to decide how many people to show the tweet to. No reply = lower ceiling.
- **Quote yourself:** 1–2 times a week, quote one of your own tweets with a “one more thing” or a follow-up. Double exposure, same audience.
- **Weekly thread:** Once a week, turn one idea into a thread: tweet 1 = hook, then 2–3 replies with the breakdown. Threads get more reach than single tweets. You can do this manually (e.g. Sunday evening) on a topic you’ve already tested as a single tweet.
- **Reply to people who engage:** When someone replies or quotes you, reply back. They’re more likely to engage again and to follow.

## 5. Metrics to watch (CEO dashboard)

| Metric | Why it matters |
|--------|-----------------|
| Impressions per tweet | Are we improving as followers grow? |
| Engagement rate (likes + replies + retweets / impressions) | Quality signal. Algorithm pushes high-engagement tweets. |
| Follower growth | More followers = more baseline impressions. |
| Best-performing content type | Double down (e.g. if “question” beats “info”, lean into questions). |
| Best-performing time | Confirm 8 AM / 1 PM / 6:30 PM / 9 PM or adjust. |

Check X Analytics weekly. If one slot or one type consistently wins, do more of that.

## 6. Realistic milestones (stretch vs base)

| Phase | Target (impressions) | Focus |
|-------|----------------------|--------|
| **Month 1** | 800k – 1.2M | Habit, voice, first viral-ish tweet. Find what gets replies. |
| **Month 2** | 1.5M – 2M | Double down on winning formats. Reply game strong. Follower growth. |
| **Month 3** | 2M – 2.5M+ | Full system: 4 tweets, threads, replies. Push for 5M total. |

**5M in 3 months = stretch.** 3–4M is a strong base case. Hitting 5M usually needs a couple of high-reach tweets (100k+ impressions) or steady follower growth into the 15–20k+ range. The playbook is built to create those conditions.

## 7. Tactical checklist (do this, not just read)

- [ ] **4 tweets/day:** 8 AM, 1 PM, 6:30 PM, 9 PM IST (workflows: tweet-run-1 through tweet-run-4).
- [ ] **Replies:** 3–5 valuable replies on big accounts daily.
- [ ] **First hour:** Reply to every comment on your new tweets within 60 min when possible.
- [ ] **Pin:** One “who I am / what I tweet” tweet pinned.
- [ ] **Weekly:** One thread (manual) + one cross-post to LinkedIn.
- [ ] **Weekly:** Check X Analytics; note best time and best content type.
- [ ] **Revenue:** When eligible (X Premium + requirements), turn on Creator subscriptions / Ads revenue share.

## 8. Summary

- **Content:** Morning = data/theory. Rest = questions, polls, cricket. Add 4th tweet at 9 PM IST.
- **Distribution:** Replies on big accounts, hashtags, cross-post, pinned tweet.
- **Engagement:** First-hour replies, quote yourself sometimes, weekly thread.
- **Metrics:** Impressions per tweet, engagement rate, followers, best type and time.
- **Mindset:** 5M is the stretch; 3–4M is a win. Execute the system and let the algorithm work.

You’re the CEO. Ship the product (tweets), run distribution (replies + hashtags), and close the loop (engagement). Then iterate from the numbers.
